## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/gitraya/my-unsplash/blob/master/public/overview.png)

This is my solution for My Unsplash challenge in the full-stack path at DevChallenges.io. and in this project, I learn how to build a full-stack application with React, Express, and MongoDB. and I learn how to create a pagination API with Express and Mongoose.

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

## Features

- I can see a list of photos in the masonry layout that I have added
- I can add a new photo to the list - the new photo should be on top of the list
- I can search for photos by label
- When I hover a photo, I can see a label and a delete button
- I can delete images
- When I delete an image, I can enter my password

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/rYyhwJAxMfES5jNQ9YsP) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.
